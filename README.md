Documentation README Requirements
 Create a README.md file for your app that includes the full list of requirements from this page. The ones you have completed should be bolded or checked off. (You bold things in Markdown by using two asterisks, like this: **This text would be bold** and this text would not be)

 The README.md file should use markdown formatting and be clear / easy to read.

 The README.md file should include a 1-paragraph (brief OK) description of what your application does

 The README.md file should include a detailed explanation of how a user can user the running application (e.g. log in and see what, be able to save what, enter what, search for what... Give us examples of data to enter if it's not obviously stated in the app UI!)

 The README.md file should include a list of every module that must be installed with pip if it's something you installed that we didn't use in a class session. If there are none, you should note that there are no additional modules to install.

 The README.md file should include a list of all of the routes that exist in the app and the names of the templates each one should render OR, if a route does not render a template, what it returns (e.g. /form -> form.html, like the list we provided in the instructions for HW2 and like you had to on the midterm, or /delete -> deletes a song and redirects to index page, etc).
